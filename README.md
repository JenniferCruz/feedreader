# Project Overview

This project was done for the [JavaScript Testing course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549) that is part of the [Udacity's Front-End Development Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)'s program. In this project I received a [web-based application that reads RSS feeds](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader), and was given the task to complete its test suite using [`Jasmine`](http://jasmine.github.io/). Those tests cover the underlying business logic of the application as well as event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Running the application
 - go to https://jennifercruz.github.io/feedreader or 
 - download it from [this Github repository](https://github.com/JenniferCruz/feedreader) and load the index.html into Chrome or Mozilla.
